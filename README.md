# The-Genetic-Rainbow
A genetic algorithm I built to show the capabilities of an evolutionary algorithm. It's meant to find the exact color combo of a double rainbow. I know the exact combo of an exact double rainbow, so I have a model to base my algorithms predictions correctness, and that's what strengthens each generation/prediction that is processed.
